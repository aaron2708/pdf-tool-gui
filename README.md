# Description
This app was built using Tkinter and PyPDF4.

The goal was to continue practicing with Tkinter as well
as using more components, such as menus, message boxes and dialogs.

With PyPDF4, PDF files can be merged, split, or password protected
from the tkinter user interface.

Pypubsub is used to send messages between frames and from the menu
to the primary app controller.

Button icons are from Iconfinder, links to each can be found in `attributions.html`.

_This app was built for Tkinter practice_
